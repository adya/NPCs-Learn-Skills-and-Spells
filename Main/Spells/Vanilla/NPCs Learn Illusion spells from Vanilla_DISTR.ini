;;; Vanilla Illusion Spells

; Notes:
; Left Hand  - aux/utility hand. 
; Right Hand - offensive hand.
; There is no Dual Casting in Illusion as there are no spells that are meaningful to dual cast (in a fake fashion similarly to other schools).
;
; Note that Illusion magic is mostly (or completely) unused by NPCs, so this file only marks NPCs that they "know" spells (except Invisibility, I think there is a chance they'd use it).
